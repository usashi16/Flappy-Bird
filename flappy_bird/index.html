        The Tale of Fappy the Flappy Bird<br><br>

        Once upon a time, Fappy, a stubborn little bird with questionable flying skills, had one dream: to navigate an endless gauntlet of oversized green pipes. With every flap, he soared two feet, only to plummet like a feathery brick.
        
        <br>Each pipe mocked him—narrow, cruel, and oddly placed. But Fappy refused to quit, respawning endlessly like a pixelated phoenix. His journey was a cycle of hope, faceplants, and determination, as unseen players screamed at their screens, rooting for—or laughing at—his ridiculous quest.
        
        <br>Though Fappy never truly won, his legacy endured: a symbol of perseverance, rage-quits, and shattered phones. Flap on, Fappy. Flap on.
